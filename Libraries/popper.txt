Installation
Popper.js is available on the following package managers and CDNs:

Source	
npm	npm install popper.js --save
yarn	yarn add popper.js
NuGet	PM> Install-Package popper.js
Bower	bower install popper.js --save
unpkg	https://unpkg.com/popper.js
unpkg, minified	https://unpkg.com/popper.js/dist/umd/popper.min.js
Tooltip.js as well:

Source	
npm	npm install tooltip.js --save
yarn	yarn add tooltip.js
Bower*	bower install tooltip.js=https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js --save
unpkg	https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js
unpkg, minified	https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js/dist/umd/tooltip.min.js

*: Bower isn't officially supported, it can be used to install Tooltip.js only trough the unpkg.com CDN. This method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library. Bower and Popper.js suggests to use npm or Yarn for your projects.

Dist targets
Popper.js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind: UMD, ESM, and ESNext.
No idea what am I talking about? You are looking for UMD probably.

UMD - Universal Module Definition: AMD, RequireJS, and globals;
ESM - ES Modules: For webpack/Rollup or browser supporting the spec;
ESNext: Available in /dist, can be used with webpack and babel-preset-env;
Make sure to use the right one for your needs. If you want to import it with a <script> tag, use UMD.
If you can't find the /dist folder in the Git repository, this is because the distribution files are shipped only to Bower, npm or our CDNs. You can still find them visiting https://unpkg.com/popper.js/dist/ (or https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js/dist
