    <div class="column">
        Here I am trying responsive design. The text is separated in 2 divs. When the screen is small they seems together as they have no separations.
    </div>

    <div class="column">
        When I expand the screen, the 2 parts will be separed in columns. The columns will go wider when the screen goes wider as well.
